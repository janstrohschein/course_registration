# Course registration
The developed tool can be used to organize courses, certifications or any other event that needs a registration and subsequent handling of the  registered users. Views in this project divide the users in teachers and students. The following chapter describes the different functions for both groups.

## Student functionality
+ create accounts to organize courses, certifications, etc.
+ register for available courses
+ track their course progress

## Teacher functionality
+ create courses with a unique url and customizable registration form
+ different iterations for a course make the forms reusable and enable a course history
+ introduce different stages of progress into your courses
+ track and review student progress
+ export participant data as Excel files
+ communicate per e-mail with students on track and those that did not reach the current progress
